= NextGEN Gallery - Search Galleries =

NextGEN Gallery - Search Galleries adds a search option to the existing NextGEN Gallery menu.

With this search option you can quickly and easily search through your galleries so you don’t have to go through a whole listst of galleries.

The output of the search will show in a table similar to the manage galleries page and will provide a link to that gallery.

NextGEN Gallery - Search Galleries even adds an option to search in the description which can be helpfull if you don’t remember the name.

And NextGEN Gallery - Search Galleries also has the ability to search for part of the name or description. 

For instance: **int** will find **int**ernet, but also w**int**er, ballpo**int**, sa**int**s etc.

Please note: this plugin requires NextGEN Gallery installed.
